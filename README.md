# Udacity ML course

## Setup of this project

I created a new Pure Python project
and I selected `/usr/local/bin/python3` as interpreter.

Note: for some reason, `/usr/bin/python3` gave an error.

Then I created the `setup.py` (via Tools menu).
I added the `install_requires` and then
accepted the suggestion of PyCharm to install requirements.
